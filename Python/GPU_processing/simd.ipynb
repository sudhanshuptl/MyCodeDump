    "\n",
    "Most modern CPUs have support for instructions that apply the same operation to multiple data elements simultaneously.  These are called \"Single Instruction, Multiple Data\" (SIMD) operations, and the LLVM backend used by Numba can generate them in some cases to execute loops more quickly.  (This process is called \"autovectorization.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Intel processors have support for SIMD instruction sets like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SSE (128-bit inputs)\n",
    "* AVX (256-bit inputs)\n",
    "* AVX-512 (512-bit inputs, Skylake-X and later or Xeon Phi)\n",
    "\n",
    "These wide instructions typically operate on as many values as will fit into an input register.  For AVX instructions, this means that either 8 float32 values or 4 float64 values can be processed as a single input.  As a result, the NumPy dtype that you use can potentially impact performance to a greater degree than when SIMD is not in use."
