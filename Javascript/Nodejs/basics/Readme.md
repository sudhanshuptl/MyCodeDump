# Javascript in Browser
* window object is top level object that contain everything in browser (`try command window in console to see all sub funcntionality`) 

* `document` or `window.document` contain everything about that web page
`document.querySelector("body").style.backgroundColor="green"` will change background color on any web page.

# Nodejs
* just like `window` in javascript `global` in node is top level object contains everything.
* `process` within `global` represents `document` in javascript

* Entire application runs in a `process` and `export` is part of it, so exporting anything in one module create its visiiity to everywhere in `process`.
